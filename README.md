# cipher tools
This tool performs encryption on any file and embed the data in an image file, or restore decrypted file from image file.
You can use this tool to hide your data in a plain sight. Even if attacker finds data embedded into image, they can't decrypt it unless they know the key.

##How to Use
Simply running
```
python ciphertools.py
```
is sufficient.
It then prompts you to choose a working directory.
After the data is embedded, the original file will be deleted.
